This is a relatively simple board game created as part of an assignment.

It includes an 8x8 Grid. 
The user can create pieces and then move them around the grid as the rules permit.

Types of pieces include:
Slow (default): Can move left or right by 1 space.
Fast: Can move left or right an arbitrary number of spaces.
Slow Flexible: Can move in any direction by 1 space.
Fast Flexible: Can move in any direction an arbitrary number of spaces.

Currently there is no streamlined interface to play the game, nor an end state. 
You can test it out by running the GameDemo class. Type help for a list of commands.
